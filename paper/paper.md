# Abstract

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has established itself as a crucial resource for researchers and clinicians in the rare disease field, offering a standardized vocabulary for over 8,000 phenotypic abnormalities since its introduction in 2008. Widely adopted for patient phenotyping, HPO enhances the accuracy of clinical descriptions, making it an integral component in the creation of patient profiles within registries. Its hierarchical structure and interoperability with other ontologies have expanded its utility in computational tools like PubCaseFinder and LIRICAL, which support differential diagnosis and variant identification. Despite HPO's widespread adoption, accurately identifying and recommending relevant phenotypes for deep phenotyping remains a significant challenge. To address this, we developed a tool that recommends HPO terms based on a co-occurrence matrix derived from seven years of PubCaseFinder queries, totaling approximately 80,000 searches. These queries, primarily from undiagnosed patients with suspected rare and genetic diseases, average 4.27 HPO terms per search, spanning from root to leaf terms. In this study, we split the search queries into training and test datasets to construct a co-occurrence matrix and evaluate the predictive accuracy of our tool. Our findings demonstrate that utilizing extensive HPO-based patient profiles from registries as training data significantly enhances the tool's accuracy. This tool, therefore, holds substantial potential for supporting deep phenotyping in various systems, contributing to more precise patient profiling and diagnosis, and ultimately improving patient outcomes.


# Introduction

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has become an indispensable resource for researchers and clinicians in the field of rare diseases. Since its introduction in 2008, HPO has grown to include a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities associated with over 8,000 diseases [@citation:robinson2008human]. This comprehensive and well-defined set of terms has facilitated patient phenotyping, allowing for more accurate and detailed descriptions of clinical abnormalities [@citation:kohler2014human]. As a result, HPO has become the de facto standard for patient phenotyping in rare diseases, widely adopted by researchers, clinicians, informaticians, and patient registry systems globally [@citation:kohler2019expansion].

HPO's hierarchical organization and interoperability with other ontologies have significantly enhanced its utility in computational tools [@citation:kohler2019encoding]. By using HPO for creating patient profiles, patient repositories such as PhenomeCentral [@citation:buske2015phenomecentral] and IRUD [@citation:adachi2017japan], both participants in the Matchmaker Exchange project, facilitate the precise description and comparison of clinical features across patients [@citation:boycott2022seven]. PubCaseFinder, a phenotype-driven differential diagnosis tool, leverages HPO to generate ranked lists of rare diseases by comparing patient phenotypes with known disease profiles [@citation:fujiwara2018pubcasefinder]. Similarly, LIRICAL utilizes HPO terms to identify potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data [@citation:robinson2020interpretable]. These systems underscore the critical role of HPO in modern medical research and diagnostics.

Despite the HPO’s success, one of the ongoing challenges in its application is the accurate and effective identification of patient's phenotypes for deep phenotyping [@citation:shen2017phenotypic; @citation:son2018deep; @citation:steinhaus2022deep; @citation:wang2022deep; @citation:havrilla2022phenominal]. The ability of deep phenotyping not only helps in creating a more complete patient profile but also enhances the accuracy of computational diagnostic tools that rely on phenotype-based comparisons [@citation:yuan2022evaluation].

To address this challenge, we developed a new tool designed to recommend HPO terms closely related to one or more given HPO terms. This tool recommends HPO terms based on a co-occurrence matrix of HPO terms, which was created from seven years' worth of queries consisting of combinations of HPO terms entered into PubCaseFinder [@citation:fujiwara2022advances]. For seven years, PubCaseFinder has processed approximately 80,000 searches, primarily consisting of phenotypes from undiagnosed patients suspected of having rare and genetic diseases. On average, each query includes 4.27 HPO terms, ranging from those near the root to leaf terms, covering a wide spectrum of HPO terms. In this study, we divided the search queries into training and test datasets, created a co-occurrence matrix using the training dataset, and demonstrated the predictive accuracy of our tool using the test dataset. We also show that by using the vast HPO-based patient profiles maintained by patient registries as training data, it is possible to build a more accurate tool. This tool facilitates more accurate and comprehensive deep phenotyping in many existing systems. This, in turn, can lead to more precise creating patient profiles and diagnoses, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.


# Method
## The methods employed included the following steps:

### Data Preprocessing

**Data Collection:**  
We utilized two primary data sources: PubCaseFinder query logs and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) annotations.  
We extracted 71,029 queries from the PubCaseFinder logs, covering the period from June 8, 2021, to August 26, 2024.  
We also used 12,629 HPO annotations of rare diseases [@citation:robinson2008human].

**Data Collapsing:**  
To eliminate biases in our queries due to user-repetition, we conducted the following process:

- Find queries that start with the same N terms (N = 1 or 2)
- For the lines in the queries:
    - Sort
    - Remove full duplicate lines
    - Remove lines that are complete prefixes of the next

### Training and Test Datasets

**Training Datasets:**  
For the training of our models, we used three different datasets:

- Training dataset 1: collapsed file from 2021–2023.
- Training dataset 2: Training dataset 1 + collapsed file from January 1, 2024 to May 2, 2024.
- Training dataset 3: Training dataset 1 + HPO annotation file.

**Test Dataset:**  
In the case of the test dataset, we used queries from the collapsed file from May 2, 2024 to August 26, 2024.



## Data Preprocessing
To eliminate biases of overrepresented HPO terms in the PubCaseFinder queries, we eliminate duplicated lines and lines that were complete prefixes of other lines, which would indicate that they were lines written by the same user while creating an adequate query for them. The step of user-curated HPO terms is what we want to optimize by generating a suggestion tool for the PubCaseFinder browser.
